This CSS file (`login.css`) defines the styling for a login page, likely for a platform called "ClassLink".

Here's a summary of its key features:

*   **Overall Layout:**
    *   The `html` and `body` are set up for a full-height page with a fixed footer.
    *   A `radialoverlay2.png` image is used as a background, covering the entire page, with a fallback `background-color` of `#1D5D7C` (a dark blue/teal).
    *   Default font is 'Roboto', sans-serif, with a dark text color and a subtle text shadow.

*   **Main Container:**
    *   `.container1` limits the main content width to `440px` and centers it.

*   **Headings:**
    *   `h1` elements in `.heading` are large, white, and centered.
    *   `h1` elements in `.heading-chromebook` are smaller and also white and centered, suggesting specific styling for Chromebook users.

*   **Form Elements (`.login`):**
    *   **Form Groups:** Have left-aligned text and a bottom margin.
    *   **Form Controls (Inputs):**
        *   Large padding and height (`60px`), rounded corners (`6px`).
        *   Subtle box shadows.
        *   `font-weight: 600` and `font-size: 18px`.
        *   Focus state adds a `#39add0` (light blue) box shadow.
        *   `.form-control-chromebook` provides smaller versions for Chromebooks.
    *   **Required Fields:** Display a `required.png` image and a red box shadow (`#ec2227`). A small red label is absolutely positioned within the field.
    *   **Password Toggle:** A `show-password` button (styled with FontAwesome icons, though the icon itself isn't defined in this snippet) allows toggling password visibility, positioned to the right of the input.

*   **Buttons (`.btnlogin`, `.btn-primary`):**
    *   **Primary Button:** Large height (`60px`), light blue background (`#39add0`), dark blue border, large font size (`22px`), rounded corners, and a prominent bottom box shadow (`#20748D`) for a "pressed" effect. Hover/focus changes background and removes outline. Active state removes shadow and slightly translates the button.
    *   **Chromebook Primary Button:** Smaller version (`40px` height, `14px` font) of the primary button.
    *   **Google Button:** Specific styling for Google login, with a distinct blue background (`#4285F4`), custom box shadows, and an `img` for the Google logo. Chromebook version is also provided.

*   **Social Links (`.social-link`):**
    *   Centered section for social login options.
    *   Circular buttons with a bottom box shadow.
    *   Icons (`.fa`) are displayed within these circles, with a hover effect that changes the icon's background color and color based on the social provider (Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, UniLogin, SAML, QR Code, Face).
    *   Specific image-based icons are defined for QR code and face logins.
    *   Chromebook versions (`.social-link-chromebook`) are also present, with slightly different sizing and margins.

*   **Footer:**
    *   Fixed at the bottom of the page, `74px` high, centered text.
    *   Contains an unordered list of links, separated by white circular "dots".
    *   Includes styling for a "logo-lp" (LaunchPad logo) and app store/play store links.
    *   Chromebook specific footer styling is also present.

*   **Alert Messages (`.cl-alert`):**
    *   Absolutely positioned, white text, bold, with padding and rounded corners.
    *   Includes a "tip" image (`alert-tip.png`) for pointing.
    *   Red and black alert variations are defined.

*   **Responsive Design:**
    *   Media queries adjust layout and element sizes for various screen widths (e.g., `max-width: 1110px`, `880px`, `767px`, `480px`, `400px`) and heights (`max-height: 900px`). This includes changes to footer spacing, password field padding, and social link button sizes.
